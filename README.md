### ABSTRACT

-- Fill in abstract here --

### Research Questions

-- Write down research questions here --

### Proposed additional datasets

-- If we use any additional datasets, write them down here

### Methods

To study the different aspects mentioned above, several methods need to be used.

    - Characteristics Identification (Gender, Race, Age) : Data extracted from Wikidata [WHAT TO DO WHEN NOT POSSIBLE? GENDER CAN BE TAKEN FROM NLTK, BUT RACE AND AGE DOESN'T SEEM FEASIBLE]
    - Theme Identification : [BY CHARACTERISTIC? BY NEWSPAPER? BY MEDIA FORMAT?] Theme identification within a group of document can be performed using 'Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency' (or <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf' target='_blank'>TF-IDF</a>). This method allows to spot the most relevant key words in a group of documents. [WE STILL NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GROUP THESE WORDS INTO CATEGORIES]
    - Text Sentiment : [STILL NEED TO LOOK UP FOR SOME PACKAGES FOR THIS. PROBABLY NLTK HAS SOMETHING]
    - Text Readability / Complexity : <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale%E2%80%93Chall_readability_formula' target="_blank">Dale-Chall Readability Formula</a>
    - Some kind of policital analysis : [GOING TO LOOK INTO THIS, BUT SEEMS FUNDAMENTALLY THE SAME AS THEME IDENTIFICATION]
